    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm Drew Smith, and I am a student of Computer Science at Colorado College. I wanted to learn how the internet works better, so I created this website in my free time. I hope you like it!
    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website! Here you can find: <br>

    - Some ramblings <br>
    - The "Skylander of the Day" (who I currently have sitting on the portal at home) <br>
